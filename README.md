[StatsPlot](https://github.com/Parici75/statsplot) is a Python data visualization library based on Plotly. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and interactive statistical data visualization plots.

The development of this library paralleled the fantastic [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) API.

Philosophy
-
Compared to `plotly.express` API, StatsPlots :
- respects common conventions of statistical visualization (e.g., histograms are not barplots).
- processes color coding scheme, trace slicer and plot dimensions independently. 

This flexibility allows to leverage the powerful interactivity offered by plotly.js without compromising statistical intelligibility for aesthetic choices, or vice-versa.
